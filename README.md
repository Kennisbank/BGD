# BredeGroeneDijk
The Wide Green Dike Project

This model was developed by Peter Jansson and colleagues as part of a task to conceptualise an innovative infrastructure renewal process in the Netherlands as a System Dynamics problem, including barriers to upscaling. 



The dashboard can be accessed [here](https://exchange.iseesystems.com/public/maaike-van-aalst/dijken-en-natuur). The project is led by the waterboard Hunze en Aa's. More info on the stakeholders involved can be found [here](https://www.hunzeenaas.nl/projecten/brede-groene-dijk/).
